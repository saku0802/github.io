      <p>
          My strengths lie in my data-driven approach and continuous learning attitude. In SNS marketing, I have consistently delivered highly reproducible results based on thorough analysis and strategic planning, rather than relying on superficial techniques. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Adaptability to new technologies and platforms is another one of my key traits. I actively utilize AI tools to improve work efficiency and develop innovative marketing solutions. For example, I have built an automated information gathering system using X (formerly Twitter) and Dify to constantly stay updated on the latest trends. 
      </p>
      <p>
          In leadership, I prioritize the success of team members and build trust through close communication. This enables me to boost overall team motivation and achieve high performance. 
      </p>
      <p>
          I am always eager to take on new challenges, learn new skills, and tackle difficult tasks. This attitude has led to several achievements, such as successfully managing an engineering team as PM despite having no prior programming knowledge, and responding swiftly to rapid market changes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Going forward, I aim to contribute to the growth and development of the organization by leveraging my expertise in SNS marketing and leadership skills.
